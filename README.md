### GFModules National Referral Index (NRI) or Nationale Verwijs Index (NVI)

The National Referral Index (NRI) is responsible for the referral of the Health Data. The NRI contains a referral
to the register that associates a Health Provider with pseudonym and data domain.


## Usage

The application is a FastAPI application, so you can use the FastAPI documentation to see how to use the application.

## Development

You can either run the application natively or in a docker container. If you want to run the application natively you
can take a look at the initialisation steps in `docker/init.sh`. 

The preferred way to run the application is through docker.

Before you start this docker compose project, make sure you have the gfmodules-coordination docker compose
project running. For more information about setting up the whole project stack, read the gfmodules development
[readme](https://github.com/minvws/gfmodules-coordination?tab=readme-ov-file#development)

If you run Linux, make sure you export your user ID and group ID to synchronize permissions with the Docker user.

```
export NEW_UID=$(id -u)
export NEW_GID=$(id -g)
```

After this you can simply run `docker compose up`. 

The application will be available at https://localhost:8501 when the startup is completed.
